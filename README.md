# EncUtils

EncUtils is a JavaScript-based Unicode and Base64 encoding utility library. It lets you convert text into its various representations, such as UTF-8, UTF-16 Big/Little Endian, UTF-32 Big/Little Endian and convert it back. It also allows you to convert byte sequences to Base64 strings and vice versa.

More information about the library and usage guide available on the [project website](http://cerosrhino.github.io/enc-utils/).

# EncUtils

EncUtils is a JavaScript-based Unicode and Base64 encoding utility library. It lets you convert text into its various representations (such as UTF-8, UTF-16 Big/Little Endian and UTF-32 Big/Little Endian - in binary, hexadecimal and Base64) and convert it back.

More information about the library and a usage guide available on the [project website](http://cerosrhino.github.io/enc-utils/).
